In an influential 1977 article, "Essentials of Servant Leadership," Robert Greenleaf, an AT&T executive and management researcher, proposed a leadership style in which leaders put the needs, aspirations, and interests of their followers above their own. These leaders seek to help their followers "grow healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, and more likely themselves to become servants," Greenleaf wrote. If the primary goal of traditional leadership is to further the  organization's goals, the purpose of servant leadership is to "serve others to be what they are capable of becoming," write Sen Sendjaya and James C. Sarros of Monash University in Australia [in a 2002 article](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/107179190200900205).

AT&T 高管兼管理研究员罗伯特-格林利夫 (Robert Greenleaf) 在 1977 年发表的一篇颇具影响力的文章《仆人式领导的要素》中提出了一种领导风格，在这种风格中，领导者将追随者的需求、愿望和利益置于自身之上。格林利夫写道，这些领导人寻求帮助他们的追随者"变得更健康、更明智、更自由、更自主，并且更有可能成为仆人"。澳大利亚莫纳什大学的 Sen Sendjaya 和 James C. Sarros 在 2002 年的一篇文章中写道，如果传统领导力的主要目标是推进组织的目标，那么仆人式领导力的目的就是"服务他人，让他们成为有能力的人"。文章。
